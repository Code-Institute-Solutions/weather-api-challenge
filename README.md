# Weather API sample

This uses the OpenWeatherMap.org API to retrieve the current weather and weather icon for cities around the world.

A valid API key is required. The challenges are as follows:

## REQUIRED:

Add the following features to the current project:
* The temperature in degrees Celsius (currently it is in Kelvin)
* The current air pressure and wind speed
* Style the data and present it nicely

## BONUS ROUND:

Use the documentation here: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5

Create another button that displays a forecast for the city.

Think about the logic needed to do this. Can it be done with the current functions? Do they need to be duplicated?

## OPTIONAL:

Add the sunset time for the chosen city. It is returned as a Unix timestamp.
Research how to convert a Unix timestamp to a human-readable time format in JavaScript.
